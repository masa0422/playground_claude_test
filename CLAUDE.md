# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is currently an empty playground/test directory. No project structure, build system, or codebase has been initialized yet.

## Current Configuration

The only existing configuration is in `.claude/settings.local.json` which allows:
- `ls` commands via Bash
- `find` commands via Bash

## When a Project is Initialized

Once a project is set up in this directory, this file should be updated with:
1. Build, test, and lint commands specific to the technology stack
2. Project architecture and key directories
3. Development workflow instructions
4. Any project-specific conventions or patterns

Until then, Claude should help initialize the appropriate project structure based on user requirements.
